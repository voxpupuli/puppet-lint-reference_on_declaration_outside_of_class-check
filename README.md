    package { 'foo':
      ensure => present,
    }
    file { '/tmp/foo':
      ensure  => file,
      require => Package['foo2'],
    }
  }
```
and will result in the following warning:

```
WARNING: reference on non local resource declaration
```

### reference_on_foreign_class

This check will raise a warning for any class reference that is not declared inside the class.

```
   class 'demo' {
     class { 'demo::install': }
     include demo::config
     Class['demo::install'] -> Class['foobar']
   }
```
and will result in the following warning:
